This is a basic shell with features for creating a Windows App. 
This application has the ability to serialize objects and save and open these objects from a file. 

Classes:

from XML. This allows them to be saved to a file or to a database field very easily and retrieved

Project - A global class that wrappers all domain classes for the specific application

displayed in the interface and how they are saved and retrieved from a file.
